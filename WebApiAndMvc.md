 **1..Difference between Middleware and Action Filters** in ASP.NET (Core or MVC) lies in their **purpose, scope, and where they fit in the request pipeline**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. **Middleware**

### âœ… Definition:

Middleware is **global logic** that runs early in the request pipelineâ€”before routing, MVC, and filters. It's used to process or modify HTTP requests/responses.

### âœ… Characteristics:

* Runs **before and after** the routing to controller/actions.
* Works on **all requests** (not just MVC).
* Applied in `Startup.cs` (`Program.cs` in .NET 6+).
* Can short-circuit the pipeline (e.g., return a response early).

### âœ… Common Use Cases:

* Authentication
* Logging
* CORS
* Exception handling
* Custom headers

### âœ… Example:

```csharp
public class CustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Do something before controller
        await _next(context);
        // Do something after controller
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”¹ 2. **Action Filter**

### âœ… Definition:

Action Filters are part of the **MVC pipeline** and are used to execute logic **before or after** a controller action executes.

### âœ… Characteristics:

* Runs **within the MVC pipeline** (after routing).
* Can be applied **globally, to a controller, or to an action**.
* Only works on **MVC or Web API requests**.
* More granular than middleware.

### âœ… Types of Filters:

* `ActionFilter`
* `AuthorizationFilter`
* `ExceptionFilter`
* `ResultFilter`

### âœ… Common Use Cases:

* Logging input/output of actions
* Validation
* Auditing
* Modifying action parameters or result

### âœ… Example:

```csharp
public class LogActionFilter : IActionFilter
{
    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        // Code before action executes
    }

    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
        // Code after action executes
    }
}
```

## ðŸ†š **Middleware vs Action Filter â€“ Quick Comparison**

| Feature               | Middleware                  | Action Filter                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Scope                 | Application-wide            | Controller/action-specific     |
| Executes              | Before/after routing        | Before/after controller action |
| Applies to            | All requests                | Only MVC/Web API               |
| Setup Location        | `Startup.cs` / `Program.cs` | Attribute or MVC configuration |
| Access to HttpContext | Yes                         | Yes                            |
| Use Cases             | Auth, logging, headers      | Logging, validation, caching   |
