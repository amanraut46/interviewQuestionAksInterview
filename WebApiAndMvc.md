 **1..Difference between Middleware and Action Filters** in ASP.NET (Core or MVC) lies in their **purpose, scope, and where they fit in the request pipeline**.

---

## üîπ 1. **Middleware**

### ‚úÖ Definition:

Middleware is **global logic** that runs early in the request pipeline‚Äîbefore routing, MVC, and filters. It's used to process or modify HTTP requests/responses.

### ‚úÖ Characteristics:

* Runs **before and after** the routing to controller/actions.
* Works on **all requests** (not just MVC).
* Applied in `Startup.cs` (`Program.cs` in .NET 6+).
* Can short-circuit the pipeline (e.g., return a response early).

### ‚úÖ Common Use Cases:

* Authentication
* Logging
* CORS
* Exception handling
* Custom headers

### ‚úÖ Example:

```csharp
public class CustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Do something before controller
        await _next(context);
        // Do something after controller
    }
}
```

---

## üîπ 2. **Action Filter**

### ‚úÖ Definition:

Action Filters are part of the **MVC pipeline** and are used to execute logic **before or after** a controller action executes.

### ‚úÖ Characteristics:

* Runs **within the MVC pipeline** (after routing).
* Can be applied **globally, to a controller, or to an action**.
* Only works on **MVC or Web API requests**.
* More granular than middleware.

### ‚úÖ Types of Filters:

* `ActionFilter`
* `AuthorizationFilter`
* `ExceptionFilter`
* `ResultFilter`

### ‚úÖ Common Use Cases:

* Logging input/output of actions
* Validation
* Auditing
* Modifying action parameters or result

### ‚úÖ Example:

```csharp
public class LogActionFilter : IActionFilter
{
    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext context)
    {
        // Code before action executes
    }

    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext context)
    {
        // Code after action executes
    }
}
```

## üÜö **Middleware vs Action Filter ‚Äì Quick Comparison**

| Feature               | Middleware                  | Action Filter                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Scope                 | Application-wide            | Controller/action-specific     |
| Executes              | Before/after routing        | Before/after controller action |
| Applies to            | All requests                | Only MVC/Web API               |
| Setup Location        | `Startup.cs` / `Program.cs` | Attribute or MVC configuration |
| Access to HttpContext | Yes                         | Yes                            |
| Use Cases             | Auth, logging, headers      | Logging, validation, caching   |

**2.ASP.NET Core, dependency injection (DI) is built-in, and the three main service lifetimes you can register are:**

---

## üîπ `AddSingleton`, `AddScoped`, and `AddTransient` ‚Äì Key Differences

| Lifetime       | Created                         | Shared                               | Use Case                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `AddSingleton` | Once for the entire application | Shared across all requests and users | Expensive services that are thread-safe and stateless |
| `AddScoped`    | Once per **HTTP request**       | Shared within that single request    | Services that maintain request-level state            |
| `AddTransient` | Every time requested            | Never shared                         | Lightweight, stateless services                       |

---

### ‚úÖ 1. `AddSingleton<TInterface, TImplementation>()`

* Creates a **single instance** for the **entire application lifetime**.
* All components that depend on this service **share the same instance**.
* **Good for**: Caching, configuration, stateless utilities.

**Example:**

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. `AddScoped<TInterface, TImplementation>()`

* Creates a **new instance per HTTP request**.
* **Same instance** is reused within that request.
* **Good for**: Services that need to maintain state per request (like DB context).

**Example:**

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. `AddTransient<TInterface, TImplementation>()`

* Creates a **new instance every time** it‚Äôs requested.
* **Never shared** ‚Äî even within the same request.
* **Good for**: Lightweight, stateless services, or short-lived objects.

**Example:**

```csharp
services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
```

---

## üß† Example Scenario:

Suppose you inject the same service into both a controller and a repository:

* **Singleton** ‚Üí Both will get **same object**, even across requests.
* **Scoped** ‚Üí Both will get **same object in same request**, but different between requests.
* **Transient** ‚Üí Both will get **different object** every time it's injected.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

* Never use **`AddSingleton` for services that depend on `Scoped` services** (like `DbContext`) ‚Äî this can cause serious threading issues.
* Use **`AddScoped` for Entity Framework DbContext** or anything request-bound.

---

Absolutely! Here's a breakdown of **use cases** for each service lifetime in **ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection**:

---

## üîπ 1. `AddSingleton` ‚Äì ‚úÖ **Use Cases**

### üü¢ Characteristics:

* Created **once** and reused for the **entire app lifetime**.
* **Shared across all requests** and users.
* Best for **thread-safe** and **stateless** objects.

### ‚úÖ Use Cases:

| Use Case                  | Why                                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Configuration readers** | Load once and use everywhere.                      |
| **Logging services**      | Can be reused across components.                   |
| **Caching services**      | In-memory caches are usually singleton.            |
| **Static data providers** | Like country/state lists.                          |
| **API client wrappers**   | e.g., `HttpClientFactory` registered as singleton. |

---

## üîπ 2. `AddScoped` ‚Äì ‚úÖ **Use Cases**

### üü° Characteristics:

* Created **once per HTTP request**.
* Same instance used **throughout the request lifecycle**.

### ‚úÖ Use Cases:

| Use Case                                          | Why                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Database context (`DbContext`)**                | Ensures consistent unit of work per request.             |
| **Repository services**                           | Shared within a single web request.                      |
| **Unit of work patterns**                         | Keep operations grouped within a request.                |
| **Business services** that maintain request state | Useful for aggregating data or caching during a request. |

---

## üîπ 3. `AddTransient` ‚Äì ‚úÖ **Use Cases**

### üîµ Characteristics:

* **New instance every time** it's requested.
* Ideal for **lightweight, stateless** services.

### ‚úÖ Use Cases:

| Use Case                                                  | Why                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Email or SMS sender service**                           | Usually short-lived, no internal state.          |
| **Input validators**                                      | Created, used, and discarded quickly.            |
| **Helper utilities** (e.g., date converters, calculators) | No shared state needed.                          |
| **Logging decorators**                                    | When per-operation instance isolation is needed. |

## üß† Summary Table

| Lifetime    | Use For                                    | Avoid For                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `Singleton` | Caching, Logging, Configs, Utilities       | Services depending on Scoped ones |
| `Scoped`    | EF `DbContext`, Repositories, Unit of Work | Long-lived objects or static data |
| `Transient` | Validators, lightweight utilities          | Heavy objects or shared services  |
