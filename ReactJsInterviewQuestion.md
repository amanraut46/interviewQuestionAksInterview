**1. Promise**, **async**, and **await** in JavaScript are closely related but serve different purposes. Here’s a clear breakdown of their differences and how they relate to each other:

---

### ✅ 1. **Promise**

A **Promise** is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

#### 🔹 Syntax Example:

```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Success");
  }, 1000);
});

promise.then(result => {
  console.log(result);
}).catch(error => {
  console.log(error);
});
```

#### 🔸 Key Points:

* Introduced in ES6.
* Has `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.
* Manages asynchronous operations.
* Can be in one of three states: **pending**, **fulfilled**, or **rejected**.

---

### ✅ 2. **async**

The `async` keyword is used to define an **asynchronous function**, which always returns a **Promise**, even if you return a simple value.

#### 🔹 Syntax Example:

```javascript
async function greet() {
  return "Hello";
}

greet().then(console.log);  // Outputs: Hello
```

#### 🔸 Key Points:

* Marks a function as asynchronous.
* Automatically wraps the return value in a Promise.
* Enables the use of `await` inside the function.

---

### ✅ 3. **await**

The `await` keyword is used **inside an async function** to pause execution until a Promise is resolved.

#### 🔹 Syntax Example:

```javascript
async function getData() {
  let result = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  let data = await result.json();
  console.log(data);
}
```

#### 🔸 Key Points:

* Can only be used inside an `async` function.
* Makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code.
* Waits for a Promise to resolve or reject.

### 🧠 Example Using All Together:

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Data fetched!"), 1000);
  });
}

async function main() {
  const data = await fetchData();
  console.log(data);  // Outputs: Data fetched!
}

main();
```

## 🔄 Summary Table: Sync vs Async Behavior in React Hooks

| Hook                   | Sync/Async                                     | Explanation                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useState`             | Synchronous call, **Async update**             | Calling `setState` is synchronous, but the state update happens on the next render. |
| `useEffect`            | Asynchronous-like                              | Runs **after render**, not during. Cannot block rendering.                          |
| `useLayoutEffect`      | Synchronous (after DOM mutation, before paint) | Runs **after DOM updates**, but **before the browser paints**, synchronously.       |
| `useRef`               | Synchronous                                    | Assigning to `.current` is immediate and doesn't trigger re-render.                 |
| `useReducer`           | Synchronous call, **Async update**             | Like `useState`. Dispatch is sync, but update takes effect on next render.          |
| `useCallback`          | Synchronous                                    | Returns a memoized version of a callback immediately.                               |
| `useMemo`              | Synchronous                                    | Returns a memoized value immediately.                                               |
| `useContext`           | Synchronous                                    | Reads context value synchronously at render time.                                   |
| `useTransition`        | Asynchronous scheduling                        | Allows marking updates as non-urgent. Transition happens asynchronously.            |
| `useDeferredValue`     | Asynchronous update                            | Defers updating value until less urgent rendering time.                             |
| `useSyncExternalStore` | Synchronous with external sync                 | For subscribing to external data sources with sync guarantees.                      |

## 🔍 Key Hooks Explained

### 1. `useState` – Sync call, Async update

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

setCount(1);
console.log(count); // Still logs 0
```

* `setCount` is **sync**, but `count` updates **on next render**, not immediately.

---

### 2. `useEffect` – Runs **after render**

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Effect runs after render");
}, []);
```

* Async-like behavior. It doesn't block rendering.
* Good for side effects like API calls.

---

### 3. `useLayoutEffect` – Sync after DOM update

```js
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  console.log("Runs before paint");
}, []);
```

* Runs **after DOM mutations**, but **before paint**.
* Can block the paint — so use sparingly.

---

### 4. `useRef` – Fully synchronous

```js
const inputRef = useRef(null);

useEffect(() => {
  inputRef.current.focus(); // Works immediately
}, []);
```

* Accessing or updating `.current` is **sync** and immediate.

---

### 5. `useTransition` – Async updates

```js
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

startTransition(() => {
  // Less urgent update
  setSomeBigState(...);
});
```

* Marks updates as **low-priority**.
* React defers them to improve UI responsiveness.

---

## ✅ Summary

* **Synchronous Hooks**: `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useContext`
* **Asynchronous Behavior**: `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useState` (update), `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`

Ah nice twist 😃 — now you mean **"Hosting in JavaScript"** (not server hosting, but the **JavaScript concept of hoisting**). Let’s frame it interview-style again:

---


# 6 **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**
In JavaScript, **hoisting** is the behavior where **variable and function declarations are moved (hoisted) to the top of their scope** (global or function scope) before code execution.

This means you can use variables or functions **before they are declared** in the code (but with important differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`).

---

### 🔹 Example with `var`

```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined (not error)
var a = 10;
```

👉 Behind the scenes, JavaScript interprets this as:

```javascript
var a;      // declaration is hoisted
console.log(a); // undefined
a = 10;     // initialization happens here
```

---

### 🔹 Example with `let` and `const`

```javascript
console.log(b); // ReferenceError
let b = 20;
```

👉 Declarations with `let` and `const` are also hoisted, but they remain in a **temporal dead zone** (TDZ) until initialized. That’s why they throw an error if accessed before assignment.

---

### 🔹 Function Hoisting

```javascript
greet(); // works fine
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

👉 Entire function declarations are hoisted, so you can call them before they appear in code.

But **function expressions** are different:

```javascript
sayHi(); // TypeError: sayHi is not a function
var sayHi = function() {
  console.log("Hi!");
};
```

---

👉 **In short:**
Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving **declarations** (not initializations) to the top of their scope.

* `var` → hoisted but initialized as `undefined`.
* `let` & `const` → hoisted but stay in **TDZ**, error if accessed early.
* Functions → fully hoisted (declaration), but function expressions are not.
